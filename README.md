GUI written in Rust with [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) for [rencfs](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs).

> [!WARNING]  
> **This is still under development. Please do not use it with sensitive data for now, please wait for a
stable release.  
> It's mostly ideal for experimental and learning projects. It serves as a reference app for a GUI for `rencfs`.**

Currently, it is working only on Linux, with plans to support macOS and Windows, Android and iOS in the future. Check out [rencfs-kotlin](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-kotlin) for the Kotlin Multiplatform app that is build ready for desktop operating systems and Android.

It uses:
- [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) with [eframe](https://crates.io/crates/eframe) for GUI
- [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) for concurrency
- [tonic](https://crates.io/crates/tonic) for gRPC communication between GUI and daemon
- [diesel](https://crates.io/crates/diesel) with Sqlite for ORM
